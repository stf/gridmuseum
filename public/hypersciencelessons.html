		    <h2>Lesson 1</h2>
			<h3>Monday, May 16th 6-8pm</h3> 
		  	<p><b>Fresh chopped salad with quick mustard vinaigrette</b></p>
			<p>Seasonal fresh vegetables provide a wealth of vitamines, minerals,
			and complex phytochemicals, including antioxidants (anthocynins,
			polyphenols, etc.) which are essential for healthy cell function. A
			well balanced, crunchy salad serves as a textual counterpoint to the
			baked pasta dish, while the acid in a tangy vinaigrette cuts through
			the creamy sauce, keeping the flavors from dulling as the meal
			progresses.</p>
		
			<p><b>Creamy bacon macaroni and cheese</b> <i>(vegetarian optional)</i><p>
			<p>Rich and satisfying, this dish contains slow release carbs (low on
				the glycemic index, which prevents spikes in blood sugar), moderate
				amounts of fat, mostly unsaturated (important for flavor and as part
				of hunger satiation), and is a wonderful source of calcium, fiber,
				vitamins A, C, E, &amp; B6, potassium, manganese and assorted minerals.</p>	
			<p><b>Flaky buttermilk drop biscuits</b></p>
			<p>Made with a whole wheat flour, this high fiber basic biscuit is a
			staple item&mdash;incredibly fast and easy to prepare, great with
			modifications (fresh herbs, cheese, diced vegetables), and perfect as
			a biscuit topping for casseroles.</p>

			<h2>Lesson 2</h2>
			<p></p>
			<p><i>To be decided by the will of the crowd and announced at a future date</i></p>

			<p>Every class comes equipped with wine or whisky (Templeton Rye, Red
			Breast, etc.) and everyone goes home with at least two servings of
			every dish.</p>
