		<p>All lessons will teach you how to organize food prep effectively. Most importantly, we explain the science behind your food—how protein is broken down, how to retain nutrient rich food in the cooking process, and how or if it blends.</p>
		<p>Every class comes equipped with Templeton Rye and everyone goes home with at least two servings of every dish.</p> 
		

		Lesson 1 focuses on shopping decisions like when to buy organic and what to buy in bulk. You'll learn the basics of how to wash, chop, cut, dice, what oils to use, and how and when to turn up the heat. 
  

		Methodically taught by:
		Merewyn Boak, biochemist & plant geneticist Villanova
