				<h4>Hyper Science Cooking</h4>
				<p>Hyper Science Cooking is our teaching methodology, explaining not
					just the rules but the reasons behind food choices and cooking
					techniques, focusing on taste, health, and the ethics of food.</p><br/>
				<h4>Where?</h4>
				<p>Food is a great community builder. We make food in our kitchens with our friends.</p>
				<p><a href="http://www.gridmuseum.com/hypersciencelessons.html"><b>Join us!</b></a></p>
				<br/>	
				<h4>Our Methodology:</h4>
				<p>Each lesson will focus on specific skills while teaching you, top to
					bottom, how to make a single delicious, healthy, multi-course meal.
					Throughout the course of the series, all of the basics needed for
					confident, creative, nourishing home chefery will be addressed,
					including:</p>
				<p><b>1.</b> How to plan meals &ndash; balancing tasty, easy, and healthy</p> 
				<p><b>2.</b> Shopping decisions &ndash; what to buy organic, what to buy in bulk, and
						how to cope with the tyranny of choice</p> 
				<p><b>3.</b> How to organize food preparation &ndash; learn to love your 'mise en place'</p>
				<p><b>4.</b> Cooking techniques &ndash; how to wash, chop, cut, dice, what oils to
						use, and how and when to turn up the heat</p>
				<p>Most importantly, we explain the science behind your food&mdash;how
							protein is broken down, how sauces thicken and how to retain nutrient
							rich food throughout the cooking process.</p>
